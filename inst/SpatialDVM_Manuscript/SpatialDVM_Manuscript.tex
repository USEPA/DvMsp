\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}

There are two general approaches for using data to make statistical
inferences about a population: design-based approaches and model-based
approaches. When data cannot be obtained for all units in a population
(known as population units), data on a subset of the population units is
collected in a sample. In the design-based approach, inferences about
the underlying population are informed from a probabilistic process in
which population units are selected to be in the sample. Alternatively,
in the model-based approach, inferences are made from specific
assumptions made about the underlying process that generated the data.
Each paradigm has a deep historical context (Sterba, 2009) and its own
set of general advantages (Hansen et al., 1983).

Though the design-based and model-based approaches apply to statistical
inference in a broad sense, we focus on comparing these approaches for
spatial data. We define spatial data as variables measured at specific
geographic locations. De Gruijter and Ter Braak (1990) give an early
comparison of design-based and model-based approaches for spatial data,
quashing the belief that design-based approaches could not be used for
spatially correlated data. Thereafter, several comparisons between
design-based and model-based for spatial data have been considered, but
they tend to compare design-based approaches that ignore spatial
location in sampling to model-based approaches (Brus and De Gruijter,
1997; Ver Hoef, 2002; Ver Hoef, 2008). Cooper (2006) review the two
approaches in an ecological context before introducing a
``model-assisted'' variance estimator that combines aspects from each
approach. In addition to Cooper (2006), there has been substantial
research and development into estimators that use both design and
model-based principles (see e.g. Cicchitelli and Montanari (2012),
Chan-Golston et al. (2020) for a Bayesian approach, and Sterba (2009)).
More recent overviews include Brus (2020) and Wang et al. (2012), but no
numerical comparison has been made between design-based approaches that
incorporate spatial sampling and model-based approaches.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section
\ref{sec:background}, we compare sampling and estimation procedures
between the design-based approach and the model-based approach. In
Section \ref{sec:numstudy}, we use simulated and real data to study the
properties of parameter estimates from both approaches. And in Section
\ref{sec:discussion}, we end with a discussion and provide directions
for future research.

\hypertarget{sec:background}{%
\section{Background}\label{sec:background}}

The design-based and model-based approaches incorporate randomness in
fundamentally different ways. In this section, we describe the role of
randomness and its effects on subsequent inferences. We then discuss
specific inference methods for the design-based and model-based
approaches for spatial data.

\hypertarget{comparing-design-based-vs.-model-based}{%
\subsection{Comparing Design-Based
vs.~Model-Based}\label{comparing-design-based-vs.-model-based}}

The design-based approach assumes the data are fixed. Randomness is
incorporated in the selection of population units according to a
sampling design. A sampling design assigns a positive probability of
inclusion in the sample (inclusion probability) to each population unit.
Some examples of commonly used sampling designs include independent
random sampling (IRS), stratified random sampling, and cluster sampling.
The goal is to use the sampling design and the sampled data to estimate
population parameters like means and totals. These population parameters
are typically assumed to be fixed but unknown.

Treating the data as fixed and incorporating randomness through the
sampling design yields estimators having very few other assumptions.
Confidence intervals for these types of estimators are typically derived
using limiting arguments. Means and totals, for example, are
asymptotically normally distributed by the Central Limit Theorem.
Särndal et al. (2003) and Lohr (2009) provide thorough reviews of the
design-based approach.

The model-based approach assumes the data are a random realization of a
process. Randomness is often incorporated through distributional
assumptions on the data-generating process. Instead of estimating fixed
but unknown parameters (as in the design-based approach), the goal of
model-based inference in the spatial context is often \emph{prediction}
of an unknown quantity. For example, suppose the realized mean of all
population units is the quantity of interest. Instead of
\emph{estimating} a fixed unknown mean, we are \emph{predicting} the
value of the mean, a random variable. We know that if we sampled all
population units, we would have an exact prediction for the mean of our
one realized process, without any uncertainty. But the true mean of the
spatial process that generated our realized data is still not known.
When predicting the realized mean, we typically are not interested in
the underlying process' true mean.

Assuming the data is a realization of a specific data-generating process
yields predictors that are linked to distributional assumptions. These
distributional assumptions are used to derive prediction intervals. The
distributional assumptions allow the prediction intervals can be more
precise. Cressie (1993) and Schabenberger and Gotway (2017) provide
reviews of model-based approaches for spatial data.

\hypertarget{spatially-balanced-design-and-analysis}{%
\subsection{Spatially Balanced Design and
Analysis}\label{spatially-balanced-design-and-analysis}}

Sampling designs can incorporate spatial locations to obtain samples
that are spatially balanced with respect to the population (Stevens Jr
and Olsen, 2004). A sample is spatially with respect to the population
if the sampled population units are a miniature of the population units.
A sample is a miniature of the population if the distribution of the
sampled population units mirrors the density of all population units.
Spatial balance with respect to the population is is different than
spatial balance with respect to geography. A sample that is spatially
balanced with respect to geography is spread out in some type of
equidistant manner over geographical space and are not meant to be
miniatures of the population. When we refer to spatial balance
henceforth, we mean spatial balance with respect to the population.

Spatially balanced samples are useful because they tend to yield
estimates that have lower variance than estimates constructed from
sampling designs lacking spatial balance (Barabesi and Franceschi, 2011;
Benedetti et al., 2017; Grafström and Lundström, 2013; Robertson et al.,
2013; Stevens Jr and Olsen, 2004; Wang et al., 2013). To quantify
spatial balance, Stevens Jr and Olsen (2004) proposed loss functions
based on Voroni polygons. The first spatiallly balanced sampling
algorithm that saw widespread use was the Generalized Random
Tessellation Stratified (Stevens Jr and Olsen, 2004). Since GRTS was
developed, several other spatially balanced sampling algorithms have
emerged, including the Local Pivotal Method (Grafström et al., 2012;
Grafström and Matei, 2018), Spatially Correlated Poisson Sampling
(Grafström, 2012), Balanced Acceptance Sampling (Robertson et al.,
2013), Within-Sample-Distance (Benedetti and Piersimoni, 2017), and
Halton Iterative Partitioning (Robertson et al., 2018) algorithms. We
focus on the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) algorithm
to select spatially balanced sampling because the algorithm has several
attractive properties detailed by Stevens Jr and Olsen (2004) and
Dumelle et al. (2021).

The GRTS algorithm is used to sample from finite and infinite
populations and works by utilizing a mapping between two-dimensional and
one-dimensional space. The population units in two-dimensional space are
divided into cells using a hierarchical index. Population units are then
mapped to a one-dimensional line via the hierarchical indexing. The line
length of each population unit equals its inclusion probability. A
systematic sample is conducted on the line and these samples are linked
to a population unit in two-dimensional space, which results in the
desired sample size. Stevens Jr and Olsen (2004) provide and Dumelle et
al. (2021) provide further details. The GRTS algorithm is available in
the \textbf{\textsf{R}} package \texttt{spsurvey} (Dumelle et al.,
2021).

After collecting a sample, the data are used to estimate population
parameters. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952)
and its continuous analog (Cordy, 1993) yield unbiased estimates of
population means and totals. If \(\tau\) is a population total, then the
Horvitz-Thompson estimator of \(\tau\) (denoted by \(\hat{\tau}_{ht}\)),
is given by \begin{align}\label{eq:ht}
  \hat{\tau}_{ht} = \sum_{i = 1}^n Z_i \pi_i^{-1},
\end{align} where \(Z_i\) and \(pi_i\) are the observed value and
inclusion probability of the \(i\)th population unit selected in the
sample. Horvitz and Thompson (1952) and Sen (1953) provide variance
estimators for \(\hat{\tau}_{ht}\), but they have two drawbacks. First,
they rely on calculating \(\pi_{ij}\), the probability that population
unit \(i\) and population unit \(j\) are included in the sample, which
can be very difficult to calculate. Second, they ignore the spatial
locations of the population units. To address these drawbacks, Stevens
Jr and Olsen (2003) proposed a local neighborhood variance estimator.
The local neighborhood variance estimator does not rely on \(\pi_{ij}\),
and it incorporates spatial locations by assigning higher weights to
nearby observations. Stevens Jr and Olsen (2003) show this variance
estimators tends to reduce the variability associated with estimating
\(\tau\). This yields confidence intervals for \(\tau\) that are
narrower than confidence intervals constructed from variance estimators
ignoring spatial locations.

\hypertarget{finite-population-block-kriging}{%
\subsection{Finite Population Block
Kriging}\label{finite-population-block-kriging}}

We only use FPBK in this paper in order to focus more on comparing the
design-based and model-based approaches. However, k-nearest-neighbors
(Fix and Hodges, 1951; Ver Hoef and Temesgen, 2013), random forest
(Breiman, 2001), Bayesian models (Chan-Golston et al., 2020), among
others, can also be used to obtain predictions for a mean or total from
spatially correlated responses in a finite population setting.

Finite Population Block Kriging (FPBK) is an alternative to
samipling-based methods (Ver Hoef, 2008). FPBK expands the
geostatistical kriging framework to the finite population setting.
Instead of basing inference off of a specific sampling design, we assume
the data were generated by a spatial process with parameters that can be
estimated using the framework of a model.

Ver Hoef (2008) gives details on the theory of FPBK, but some of the
basic principles are summarized below. For a response variable
\(\mathbf{z}\) that can be measured on a finite number of \(N\) sites,
we want to predict some linear function of the response variable,
\(\tau(\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{b}^\prime \mathbf{z}\), where
\(\mathbf{b}\) is a vector of weights. For example, if we want to
predict the total abundance across all sites, then we would use a vector
of 1's for the weights.

Typically, however, we only have a sample of the \(N\) sites. Denoting
quantities that are part of the sampled sites with a subscript \emph{s}
and quantities that are part of the unsampled sites with a subscript
\emph{u},

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \label{equation:Zmarginal}
    \mathbf{z}_s      \\
    \mathbf{z}_u
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mathbf{X}_s    \\
  \mathbf{X}_u
\end{pmatrix}
\bm{\beta} +
\begin{pmatrix}
\bm{\delta}_s    \\
\bm{\delta}_u
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation} where \(\mathbf{X}_s\) and \(\mathbf{X}_u\) are the
design matrices for the sampled and unsampled sites, respectively, and
\(\bm{\delta}_s\) and \(\bm{\delta}_u\) are random errors for the
sampled and unsampled sites. Denoting
\(\bm{\delta} \equiv [\bm{\delta}_s \,\, \bm{\delta}_u]'\), we assume
that \(E(\bm{\delta})\) = \(\mathbf{0}\).

We also typically assume that there is spatial correlation in
\(\bm{\delta}\), which can be modeled using a covariance function. Many
common choices for this function assume that spatial covariance
decreases with increasing Euclidean distance between sites. The primary
function used throughout the simulations and applications of this
manuscript is the Exponential covariance function: the \(i,j^{th}\)
entry for \(\mathop{\mathrm{{var}}}(\bm{\delta})\) is \mbox{}
\begin{align}\label{equation:expcov}
\mathop{\mathrm{{cov}}}(\delta_i, \delta_j) = \theta_1\exp(-3h_{i,j}/\theta_2) + \theta_3\mathbbm{1}\{\mathbf{h}_{i,j} = 0\}, 
\end{align} where \(h_{i,j}\) is the distance between sites \(i\) and
\(j\), and \(\bm{\theta}\) is a vector of spatial covariance parameters
of the partial sill \(\theta_1\), the range \(\theta_2\), and the nugget
\(\theta_3\). However, any spatial covariance function could be used in
the place of the Exponential, including functions that allow for
anisotropy {[}pg. 80 - 93{]}(Chiles and Delfiner, 1999).

With the above model formulation, the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor
(BLUP) for \(\tau(\mathbf{b}'\mathbf{z})\)
\(\tau(\mathbf{b}'\mathbf{z})\) is vague\} and its prediction variance
can be computed. While details of the derivation are in (Ver Hoef,
2008), we note here that the predictor and its variance are both
moment-based. Neither require a particular distribution for
\(\mathbf{z}\).

\hypertarget{sec:numstudy}{%
\section{Numerical Study}\label{sec:numstudy}}

For the following simulation results, we simulated 1040 different
gridded populations, each of size 900 with sample size 150. For the
model-based approach (FPBK), sites were selected via Independent Random
Sample. For GRTS, the local mean variance was used.

The response was normally distributed with an exponential covariance
function with partial sill of 0.9, effective range of \(\sqrt{2}\), and
a nugget of 0.1. For model-based, we assumed the correct form of the
covariance function (Exponential), but estimated the spatial parameters
with REML.

FPBK can be readily performed in \texttt{R} with the \texttt{sptotal}

Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML).
