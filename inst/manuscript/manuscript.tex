\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}

There are two general approaches for using data to make statistical
inferences about a population: design-based and model-based. When data
cannot be obtained for all units in a population (population units),
data on a subset of the population units is collected and called a
sample. In the design-based approach, inferences about the underlying
population are informed from a probabilistic process in which population
units are selected to be in the sample. Alternatively, in the
model-based approach, inferences are made from specific assumptions
about the underlying process that generated the data. Each paradigm has
a deep historical context (Sterba, 2009) and its own set of general
advantages (Hansen et al., 1983).

Though the design-based and model-based approaches apply to statistical
inference in a broad sense, we focus on comparing these approaches for
spatial data. We define spatial data as data that incorporates the
specific locations of the population units into either the design or
estimation process. De Gruijter and Ter Braak (1990) give an early
comparison of design-based and model-based approaches for spatial data,
quashing the belief that design-based approaches could not be used for
spatially correlated data. Thereafter, several comparisons between
design-based and model-based for spatial data have been considered (Brus
and De Gruijter, 1997; Ver Hoef, 2002, 2008). Cooper (2006) review the
two approaches in an ecological context before introducing a
``model-assisted'' variance estimator that combines aspects from each
approach. In addition to Cooper (2006), there has been substantial
research and development into estimators that use both design and
model-based principles (see e.g.~Cicchitelli and Montanari (2012),
Chan-Golston et al. (2020) for a Bayesian approach, and Sterba (2009)).
More recent overviews include Brus (2020) and Wang et al. (2012).

Though comparisons between design-based and model-based approaches to
spatial data have been studied, no numerical comparison has been made
between design-based approaches that incorporate spatial locations and
model-based approaches. In this manuscript, we compare design-based
approaches that incorporate spatial locations to model-based approaches
for spatial data. The rest of the manuscript is organized as follows. In
Section \ref{sec:background}, we compare sampling and estimation
procedures between the design-based approach and the model-based
approach for spatial data. In Section \ref{sec:numstudy}, we use a
simulation approach to study the behavior and performance of both
approaches. In Section \ref{application}, we use both approaches to
analyze real data. And in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, we end with a
discussion and provide directions for future research.

\hypertarget{sec:background}{%
\section{Background}\label{sec:background}}

The design-based and model-based approaches incorporate randomness in
fundamentally different ways. In this section, we describe the role of
randomness and its effects on subsequent inferences. We then discuss
specific inference methods for the design-based and model-based
approaches for spatial data.

\hypertarget{comparing-design-based-and-model-based-approaches}{%
\subsection{Comparing Design-Based and Model-Based
Approaches}\label{comparing-design-based-and-model-based-approaches}}

The design-based approach assumes the population is fixed. Randomness is
incorporated via the selection of units in a sampling frame according to
a sampling design. A sampling frame is the set of all units available to
be sampled. A sampling design assigns a positive probability of
inclusion (inclusion probability) to each unit in the sampling frame.
Some examples of commonly used sampling designs include simple random
sampling, stratified random sample, and cluster sampling. These sampling
designs tend to select units from the sampling frame independently of
other units, so we call them ``Independent Random Sampling'' (IRS)
designs. The design-based approach combines the randomness of the
sampling design and the data collected via the sample to estimate
parameters (e.g.~means and totals) of a population. Generally, these
population parameters are assumed to be fixed, unknown constants.

Treating the data as fixed and incorporating randomness through the
sampling design yields estimators having very few other assumptions.
Confidence intervals for these types of estimators are typically derived
using limiting arguments that incorporate all possible randomizations of
sampling units selected via the sampling design. Means and totals, for
example, are asymptotically Gaussian by the Central Limit Theorem (under
some assumptions). If we repeatedly sample the surface, then 95\% of all
95\% confidence intervals constructed from a procedure with appropriate
coverage will contain the true, fixed mean. Särndal et al. (2003) and
Lohr (2009) provide thorough reviews of the design-based approach.

The model-based approach assumes the data are a random realization of a
data-generating process. Randomness is often incorporated through
distributional assumptions on this process and need not be incorporated
through random sampling (bottom row of Figure \ref{fig:fig1}). Instead
of estimating fixed but unknown parameters (as in the design-based
approach), the goal of model-based inference in the spatial context is
often to predict a realized variable, or value. For example, suppose the
realized mean of all population units is the value of interest. Instead
of \emph{estimating} a fixed, unknown mean, we are \emph{predicting} the
value of the mean, a random variable. We know that if we sampled all
population units (and not any units outside the population), we would be
able to exactly predict (without any uncertainty) the mean of our one
realized process. Assuming the data are realized from a specific
data-generating process yields predictions that are linked to
distributional assumptions. These distributional assumptions are used to
derive prediction intervals. If we repeatedly generate the response
values from a fixed spatial process and obtained a sample, then 95\% of
all 95\% prediction intervals constructed from a procedure with
appropriate coverage will contain their respective realized means.
Cressie (1993) and Schabenberger and Gotway (2017) provide reviews of
model-based approaches for spatial data. A visual comparison of the
design-based and model-based assumptinos is provided in Figure
\ref{fig:fig1} (Brus (2020) provides a similar figure).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{manuscript_files/figure-latex/fig1-1} \caption{A comparison of sampling under the design-based and model-based frameworks. Points circled are those that are sampled. In the top row, we have one fixed population, and three random samples of n = 4. The response values at each site are fixed, but we obtain different estimates for the mean response because the randomly sampled sites vary from sample to sample. In the bottom row, we have three realizations of the same spatial process sampled at the same locations. The spatial process generating the response values has a single mean, but the realized mean is different in each of the three panels.}\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Tony O.}: Before this section is it useful to have a section
that lays out the general site selection and general analysis options.
Thinking about site selection as design-based IRS, design-based GRTS,
Arbitrary set of sites, selection for model-based. Then general analysis
options as design-based no spatial, design-based spatial, model-based.
This four by three table would show that model-based analyses are
possible for all selection options. Design-based options with no spatial
info possible for IRS-based and GRTS-based. Design-based options with
spatial info possible for GRTS-based.

\textbf{Jay VH}: What about the design for model-based inference?
Strictly speaking, it is fixed -- there is no probabilistic use of a
randomized design. However, we are going to have to deal with Diggle et
al.~(2010).

\hypertarget{spatially-balanced-design-and-analysis}{%
\subsection{Spatially Balanced Design and
Analysis}\label{spatially-balanced-design-and-analysis}}

\textbf{Lisa M.}: Need a more precise definition of ``miniature'' in
this context, and need an example.

\textbf{Jay VH}: Saying ``the distribution of the sampled population
units mirrors the density of\ldots{}'' is confusing to me. Are these
formal statistical definitions of distribution (cumulative distribution
function) and density (probability density function)? Wouldn't IRS
sample be a miniature, as it should, on average, mirror a population?

The design-based approach can use spatial locations to obtain spatially
balanced samples. First we discuss spatial balance with respect to the
population (Stevens and Olsen, 2004). A sample is spatially balanced
with respect to the population if the sampled population units are a
miniature of the population units. A sample is a miniature of the
population if the distribution of the sampled population units mirrors
the density of all population units. Spatial balance with respect to the
population is different than spatial balance with respect to geography.
A sample that is spatially balanced with respect to geography is spread
out in some type of equidistant manner over geographical space and is
not meant to be miniatures of the population. When we refer to spatial
balance henceforth, we mean spatial balance with respect to the
population.

Spatially balanced samples are useful because they tend to yield
estimates that have lower variance than estimates constructed from
sampling designs lacking spatial balance (Barabesi and Franceschi, 2011;
Benedetti et al., 2017; Grafström and Lundström, 2013; Robertson et al.,
2013; Stevens and Olsen, 2004; Wang et al., 2013). To quantify spatial
balance, Stevens and Olsen (2004) proposed loss functions based on
Voroni polygons. The first spatially balanced sampling algorithm that
saw widespread use was the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified
(Stevens and Olsen, 2004). Since GRTS was developed, several other
spatially balanced sampling algorithms have emerged, including the Local
Pivotal Method (Grafström et al., 2012; Grafström and Matei, 2018),
Spatially Correlated Poisson Sampling (Grafström, 2012), Balanced
Acceptance Sampling (Robertson et al., 2013), Within-Sample-Distance
(Benedetti and Piersimoni, 2017), and Halton Iterative Partitioning
(Robertson et al., 2018). We focus on the Generalized Random
Tessellation Stratified (GRTS) algorithm to select spatially balanced
sampling because it has several attractive properties, including
\textbf{Lisa M.}: List major attractive properties, and detailed by
Stevens and Olsen (2004) and Dumelle et al. (2021).

The GRTS algorithm is used to sample from finite and infinite
populations and works by utilizing a mapping between two-dimensional and
one-dimensional space. The population units in two-dimensional space are
divided into cells using a hierarchical index. Population units are then
mapped to a one-dimensional line via the hierarchical indexing. The line
length of each population unit equals its inclusion probability. A
systematic sample is conducted on the line and these samples are linked
to a population unit in two-dimensional space, which results in the
desired sample. Stevens and Olsen (2004) and Dumelle et al. (2021)
provide further details.

After collecting a sample using the GRTS algorithm, the data are used to
estimate population parameters. The Horvitz-Thompson estimator (Horvitz
and Thompson, 1952) yields unbiased estimates of population means and
totals. For example, if \(\tau\) is a population total, then the
Horvitz-Thompson estimator of \(\tau\) (denoted by \(\hat{\tau}_{ht}\)),
is given by \begin{align}\label{eq:ht}
  \hat{\tau}_{ht} = \sum_{i = 1}^n Z_i \pi_i^{-1},
\end{align} where \(Z_i\) and \(\pi_i\) are the observed value and
inclusion probability of the \(i\)th population unit selected in the
sample. A similar formula exists for estimating the mean, \(\mu\).
Horvitz and Thompson (1952) and Sen (1953) provide variance estimators
for \(\hat{\tau}_{ht}\), but they have two drawbacks. First, they rely
on calculating \(\pi_{ij}\), the probability that population unit \(i\)
and population unit \(j\) are included in the sample, and this can be
very difficult to calculate. Second, they ignore the spatial locations
of the population units. To address these drawbacks, Stevens and Olsen
(2003) proposed a local neighborhood variance estimator. The local
neighborhood variance estimator does not rely on \(\pi_{ij}\), and it
incorporates spatial locations by assigning higher weights to nearby
observations. Stevens and Olsen (2003) show this variance estimators
tends to reduce the estimated standard error of \(\hat{\tau}\), yielding
narrower confidence confidence intervals for \(\tau\).

\hypertarget{finite-population-block-kriging}{%
\subsection{Finite Population Block
Kriging}\label{finite-population-block-kriging}}

Finite Population Block Kriging (FPBK) is a model-based approach that
expands the geostatistical Kriging framework to the finite population
setting (Ver Hoef, 2008). Instead of basing inference off of a specific
sampling design, we assume the data are generated by a spatial process.
Ver Hoef (2008) gives details on the theory of FPBK, but some of the
basic principles are summarized below. Let
\(\mathbf{z} \equiv \{\text{z}(s_1), \text{z}(s_2), . . . , \text{z}(s_N) \}\)
be a response vector at locations \(s_1\), \(s_2\), . . . , \(s_N\) that
can be measured at the \(N\) population units and is represented as an
\(N \times 1\) vector. Suppose we want to predict some linear function
of the response variable,
\(f(\mathbf{z}) = \mathbf{b}^\prime \mathbf{z}\), where
\(\mathbf{b}^\prime\) is a \(1 \times N\) vector of weights. For
example, if we want to predict the population total across all
population units, then we would use a vector of 1's for the weights.

However, we often only have a sample of the \(N\) population units.
Denoting quantities that are part of the sampled population units with a
subscript \emph{s} and quantities that are part of the unsampled
population units with a subscript \emph{u},

\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \label{equation:Zmarginal}
    \mathbf{z}_s      \\
    \mathbf{z}_u
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
  \mathbf{X}_s    \\
  \mathbf{X}_u
\end{pmatrix}
\bm{\beta} +
\begin{pmatrix}
\bm{\delta}_s    \\
\bm{\delta}_u
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation} where \(\mathbf{X}_s\) and \(\mathbf{X}_u\) are the
design matrices for the sampled and unsampled population units,
respectively; \(\beta\) is the parameter vector of fixed effects; and
\(\bm{\delta}_s\) and \(\bm{\delta}_u\) are random errors for the
sampled and unsampled population units, respectively. Denoting
\(\bm{\delta} \equiv [\bm{\delta}_s \,\, \bm{\delta}_u]'\), we assume
the expectation of \(\bm{\delta}\) equals \(\mathbf{0}\).

We also assume that there is spatial correlation in \(\bm{\delta}\),
which can be modeled using a covariance function. It is common to assume
the covariance function is second-order stationary and isotropic
(Cressie, 1993), and that the spatial covariance decreases as the
separation between population units increases. Many spatial covariance
functions exist, but the primary function we use throughout the
simulations and applications in this manuscript is the exponential
covariance function: the \(i,j^{th}\) entry for
\(\mathop{\mathrm{{cov}}}(\bm{\delta})\) is \mbox{}
\begin{align}\label{equation:expcov}
\mathop{\mathrm{{cov}}}(\delta_i, \delta_j) = \theta_1\exp(-3h_{i,j}/\theta_2) + \theta_3\mathbbm{1}\{\mathbf{h}_{i,j} = 0\}, 
\end{align} where \(h_{i,j}\) is the distance between population units
\(i\) and \(j\), and \(\bm{\theta}\) is a vector of spatial covariance
parameters of the partial sill \(\theta_1\), the range \(\theta_2\), and
the nugget \(\theta_3\); and, \(\mathbbm{1}\) is equal to 1 when
distance \(h_i,j\) is equal to 0, and equal to 0 otherwise. However, any
spatial covariance function could be used in the place of the
exponential, including functions that allow for non-stationarity or
anisotropy (Chiles and Delfiner, 1999, pp. 80--93).

\textbf{Lisa M.} : Include formulas. Perhaps, but, these are very heavy
in notation and matrix algebra. We might consider, however, adding the
formulas to an Appendix.

With the above model formulation, the Best Linear Unbiased Predictor
(BLUP) for \(f(\mathbf{b}'\mathbf{z})\) and its prediction variance can
be computed. While details of the derivation are in (Ver Hoef, 2008), we
note here that the predictor and its variance are both moment-based.

We note that we only use FPBK in this paper in order to focus more on
comparing the design-based and model-based approaches. However,
k-nearest-neighbors (Fix and Hodges, 1951; Ver Hoef and Temesgen, 2013),
random forest (Breiman, 2001), Bayesian models (Chan-Golston et al.,
2020), among others, can also be used to obtain predictions for a mean
or total from spatially correlated responses in a finite population
setting. We choose to use FPBK because it is faster than a Bayesian
approach and random forest and because Ver Hoef and Temesgen (2013)
showed that the method outperforms k-nearest-neighbors in many
scenarios.

\hypertarget{sec:numstudy}{%
\section{Numerical Study}\label{sec:numstudy}}

We used a numerical simulation study to investigate performance of four
design-analysis combinations, summarized in Table
\ref{tab:designanalysis}.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\caption{\label{tab:designanalysis} Types of Sampling Design and
Analysis combinations considered in the simulation study. The columns

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

We used a crossed design with the simulation parameters given in Table
\ref{tab:parmtab} for a total of 36 scenarios. All scenarios used
exponential correlation with an effective range of \(\sqrt{2}\) for
\(N = 900\) response values simulated on the unit square in either
random locations (Site Locations = Random) or gridded locations (Site
Locations = Gridded). The mean for the spatial process generating the
response was set to zero.

For the lognormal scenarios, the response values were simulated using
the specified correlation parameters using a normal distribution and
were subsequently exponentiated. A total variance of 2 and a mean of 0
on the normal scale is equivalent to a total variance of 47 and a mean
of 2.72 after exponentiation. Therefore, when the model-based methods
were used for lognormal response, the correlation was mis-specified. We
chose to simulate values with a lognormal distribution so that we could
test the model-based analysis approach with a mis-specified model and so
that we could test both analysis approaches on data that exhibits a
large amount of skewness.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}llll@{}}

\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

There were 2000 simulation trials for each of the 36 parameter
combinations. In each trial, response values were generated from a
spatial process with the specified parameters, and a GRTS sample and an
IRS sample were selected. For the GRTS sample, the design-based approach
using the local neighborhood variance (GRTS-Design) and a model-based
approach were applied (GRTS-Model). For the IRS sample, the design-based
approach using the simple random sample variance (IRS-Design) and a
model-based approach were applied (IRS-Model).

The GRTS algorithm and the local neighborhood variance estimator are
available in the \textbf{\textsf{R}} package \texttt{spsurvey} (Dumelle
et al., 2021). FPBK can be readily performed in \texttt{R} with the
\texttt{sptotal} package (Higham et al., 2020). We use \texttt{sptotal}
for both the simulation analysis and the application, estimating
parameters with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML).

Figure \ref{fig:figeff} shows the relative efficiency of the four
approaches from Table \ref{tab:designanalysis} with ``IRS-Design'' as
the baseline: \mbox{} \begin{equation*}
\text{E} = \frac{\text{rMSPE of approach}}{\text{rMSPE of IRS-Design}},
\end{equation*}

where rMSPE is the root-Mean-Squared-Prediction-Error. When there is no
spatial correlation (top row), the four approaches have approximately
equal rMSPE, even when the assumptions of the model-based approaches are
violated. So, using GRTS or using a spatial model does not result in
much loss in efficiency even if the response variable is not spatially
correlated. When there is high spatial correlation (bottom row), the
GRTS-Model approach tends to perform best, but difference in relative
efficiency between GRTS-Model and GRTS-Design is not very big. In the
lognormal, high partial sill settings (bottom-right facet), GRTS-Design
outperforms IRS-Model by a large margin, suggesting that the design
decision (whether to use IRS or GRTS) is more important than the
analysis decision (whether to analyze using model assumptions or not).

Unsurprisingly, Figure \ref{fig:figeff} also shows that, when the
assumptions for GRTS-Model are satisfied, the approach outperforms
GRTS-Design. However, even when the model that generates the data is
different than the model used to fit the data, as in the lognormal
response, the model-based approach still outperforms the design-based
approach when there is a high amount of spatial correlation.

\end{figure}

Plot Note: change colours and think about shape think about legend going
on graph

Figure \ref{fig:figconf} shows the coverage for each of the four
approaches. We see that the four approaches have somewhat similar
coverages in all settings, with GRTS-Design having slightly lower
coverage when the response is normal.

In the normal response settings, where assumptions for the model-based
approaches and the design-based approaches are satisfied, all approaches
have coverage around the nominal 0.95. Because the intervals are
symmetric, normal-based intervals, the coverages are generally lower
than the nominal 95\%. We see that, because the sampling distribution of
the mean is asymptotically normal (reference for this? a spatial version
of CLT), the coverages when the sample size is 200 are much closer to
the nominal 95\% than the coverages when the sample size is 50. In
general, the more skewed the distribution of the response, the larger
the sample size needed to ensure proper coverage of these normal-based
intervals.

Do we want to mention stuff like what's in these next bullet points or
no?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  for the model-based approach, the more skewed the population is, the
  higher the sample size needed to satisfy CLT for predicting a mean.
  The derivation of the BLUP is entirely moment-based (no distribution
  assumed) but we still need to assume a distribution to estimate
  spatial parameters and to generate bounds of a prediction interval.
\item
  many confidence intervals generated for design-based approaches also
  rely on the CLT and the normal distribution to generate the interval.
  Again, for highly skewed data with a small sample size, this
  assumption is violated even though all of the assumptions for
  generating the estimator are valid.

\section{Application}\label{application}}

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), states, and tribes
periodically conduct National Aquatic Research Surveys (NARS) in the
United States to assess the water quality of various bodies of water. We
will use the 2012 National Lakes Assessment (NLA), which measures
various aspects of lake health and quality in lakes in the contiguous
United States, to obtain an interval for mean mercury concentration.
Although all lakes in the survey were measured in 2012, there may not
always be enough time or money to do so. Therefore, we will explore
whether or not we can still obtain an adequately precise estimate for
the realized mean mercury concentration if we only take a sample of 100
of the 986 lakes.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{manuscript_files/figure-latex/figdata-1} \caption{Population distribution of mercury concentration for 986 lakes in the contiguous United States. Thirty-five lakes were dropped from the analysis because they were missing mercury concentration.}\label{fig:figdata}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:figdata} shows that mercury concentration is
right-skewed, with most lakes having a low value of mercury
concentration but a few having a much higher concentration. Mercury
concentration exhibits some spatial correlation, with high mercury
concentrations in lakes in the northeast and north central United
States. Because we are considering these lakes to be our entire
population, we know that the realized mean mercury concentration is
103.2 ng / g.

Table \ref{tab:appliedtab} shows the application of a design-based
analysis on an IRS, a model-based analysis on an IRS, a design-based
analysis on a GRTS sample, and a model-based analysis on a GRTS sample.
We see that, for all four analyses, the true realized mean mercury
concentration is within the bounds of the 95\% intervals. However, we
should not generalize the results of this particular realization to any
other data set or even to other potential samples of this data set.

\pagebreak

But, we do note a couple of patterns. The design-based IRS analysis
shows the largest standard error: a likely reason is that this is the
only approach that does not use the spatial correlation in mercury
concentration across the contiguous United States. We also see that, for
the samples drawn, the both analyses with the GRTS sampling design have
a lower standard error than the analyses with the IRS sampling design.
We would expect this to be the case for most samples because mercury
concentration exhibits spatial correlation so a spatially balanced
sample should usually yield a lower standard error. If it is acceptable
to have an interval for mean mercury concentration of about 25 ng / g
and if we ignore the other variables that the EPA collects information
on in these NLA surveys, then the EPA could consider sampling just 50
lakes to save time and money.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Pros of Design-Based (items we are not exploring): computationally
  efficient, few assumptions, more naturally handles binary data,
\item
  Pros of Model-Based (items we are not exploring): covariate inference,
  more efficient small-area estimation, model selection?, estimated
  spatial parameters to better understand spatial structure,
  site-by-site predictions/prediction map
\end{itemize}
