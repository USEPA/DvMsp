# Abstract

Q. Please review the abstract and offer suggestions.

MH: I have no additional suggestions for the abstract.

Q. Abstract comment from reviewer 1.

MH: I'm not sure which one "Reviewer 1" is. If it's the copy I'm looking at, I am not sure how to address that comment in the abstract without taking up too much space. So I would be in favor of not discussing it in the abstract, but adding a line to the paper that makes this point more clear.

# Background

Q. Hwo do you feel about the last paragraph in 2.3?

MH: I like it as some defense for our choice in what model-based method to use, but I don't think it's completely necessary. I __am__ in favor of cutting the last sentence about Bayesian methods that just pops up out of nowhere.

# Simulation Study

Q. Should this be called simulation study or numerical study?

MH: I prefer simulation. To me, a numerical study is also covered in the Application and would be appropriate if we combined the sims and the application into one section.

Q. One reviewer recommended removing table 1 (sampling-analysis combinations)

MH: I disagree. I think they're helpful: I know they don't add anything new, but I think it's a nice way to frame the discussion.

Q. Are you happy with the change to the y-axis in the facet images.

MH: This one is tough. They are now pretty wordy and Prop DE isn't the most evocative phrase, but it is nice that readers no longer have to find the information about what the y-axis is from the figure caption. The only possible fix I can think of would be defining that proportion as some symbol in line 219. Then, in the y-axis, using that symbol as $\omega = 0.1$, for example.

# Application

Q. Any changes Figure 4? Should we use full-size subfigures

MH: Yes, I think the map is much too small to be interpretable. I thought we had chatted about doing this Figure so that Figures 4 and 5 were combined. We would have three sub-figures: the histogram in the top-left, the variogram in the top-right, and the map as a subfigure spanning the bottom-right and bottom-left.

Q. Are you happy with the addition of the fitted semivariogram results in the application?

MH: Yes but we might want a statement about why the fit __looks__ poor in the Figure caption. We may not though: I'm ambivalent.

# Extra

Q. Should collapse the 36 appendix tables into 1 appendix table?

MH: No opinion.
